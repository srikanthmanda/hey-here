# HEY! HERE!!

A simple web application to generate blank HTML pages with only a background colour.

Intended as back-end for [Light My Screen](https://github.com/srikanthmanda/light-my-screen)â€”to enable sharing screen colours as beacons.

But mainly a learning exercise in [serving web content with SpringBoot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/).
